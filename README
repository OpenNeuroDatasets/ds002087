This is the diffusion MRI data acquired with and without deliberate head movements and used to investigate the correction of signal dropout as described in the following publication:

Koch A, Zhukov A, Stöcker T, Groeschel S, Schultz T. SHORE‐based detection and imputation of dropout in diffusion MRI. Magn Reson Med. 2019;00:1–13. https ://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.27893

The folder /sub-01/dwi contains diffusion-weighted MRI data with (run-2) and without (run-1) deliberate head movements, the corresponding bvec and bval files.
Additional b=0 scans acquired with reverse phase encoding (revpe) polarity are located in the folder /bidsignore/sub-01.
